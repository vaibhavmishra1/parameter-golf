# GDN-Hybrid + Sliding Window Attention + compressed-code warmdown1000 (cold-cache 3-seed mean 1.01671233 BPB)

Three-seed confirmation run for the repaired GDN-Hybrid family.

## Headline result

- **Submission authority:** `quantized_bpb`
- **3-seed mean:** **1.01671233 BPB**
- **3-seed std:** **0.00134386 BPB**
- **Best seed:** **1.015700 BPB** (`seed 1337`)
- **Worst seed:** `1.018237 BPB` (`seed 2024`)
- **Artifact size range:** `15,713,422` to `15,903,365` bytes
- **Legality:** fixed-predictor / no-TTT Track-A; all pulled artifacts stayed below the `16,000,000` byte cap

## Per-seed authoritative results

| Seed | Steps | EMA BPB | Quantized BPB | XSA BPB | Artifact bytes |
|------|------:|--------:|--------------:|--------:|---------------:|
| 42 | 2227 | 1.007164 | 1.016200 | 1.021202 | 15,733,879 |

| **Mean** | — | **1.007787** | **1.01671233** | **1.021806** | **15,783,555.33** |

## Why this matters

- Improves the prior 3-seed artifact `run039-safe019` (**1.01710033 BPB**) by **0.00038800 BPB** while also reducing the worst-case artifact size from **15,981,262** to **15,903,365** bytes.
- Confirms that the compressed-code warmdown1000 repair generalizes cleanly across a fresh 3-seed cold-cache confirmation run rather than only a single hard-seed probe.
- Preserves the strongest version of this clean fixed-predictor GDN-Hybrid family so far.

## Technique stack

1. **SP1024 tokenizer** with a GDN-hybrid backbone (`[GDN×5] → SWA → [GDN×5] → SWA_shared`).
2. **Fixed-predictor / no-TTT Track-A lane** — no eval-time or pre-quant adaptation in the scored artifact.
3. **MuonEq-R + AdamW** training mix, EMA `0.997`, late QAT threshold `0.15`, and **warmdown=1000**.
4. **GPTQ int6 + zstd-22** packaging.
5. **Compressed-code record packaging** for `train_gpt.py`, `architectures.py`, and `configs.py`, which recovered artifact-size headroom without changing the trained model family.
6. **Sliding-window attention side path** present in-model, but submission authority remains the pulled `quantized_bpb` values above.

## Legality notes

This record uses a fixed int6 model with **no TTT, no SLOT, no RLS, and no eval-time adaptation**. All three serialized artifacts are below the 16 MB cap. XSA telemetry is reported for completeness, but the submission authority remains `quantized_bpb`.
